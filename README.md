Section 1 – Cypress Setup

Section 2 – Cypress Automation Task



***Section 3 – Low-Code / AI Automation***
Explain in writing: If you had to automate the same flow (Homepage → Work → Contact form)
using a low-code or AI-powered automation tool (e.g., Testim, Mabl, Katalon), describe step
by step how you would implement it.
The flow (Homepage → Work → Contact form) would be automated as follows if I were using a lowcode/AI-powered automation tool:
• Establish the website's base URL and create a new test case.
• To document the process, go from the Homepage to the Work page and finally to the
Contact form.
• To ensure test stability, use the tool's AI or smart locators to identify items (buttons,
links, and form fields).
• Include test steps for completing the Name, Email, Subject, and Message sections
on the contact form.
• Include validations to ensure that:
    o The Work page loads properly.
    o The form for contact appears.
    o Following submission, a success message is displayed.
• Configure test data so that it can execute with different inputs (missing fields, valid/invalid email.
• Run the test across browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to ensure compatibility.
• Schedule or integrate the test into CI/CD so it runs automatically and generates reports.



**Section 4 – AI in QA***
Answer the following question in 4–6 sentences:
 “How do you think AI-based test automation will improve software testing in the next 3
years?”
1. AI test automation will increase testing speed and effectiveness.
2. Testers can save time by using it to create and maintain test cases automatically.
3. When the application user interface changes, self-healing locators will decrease flaky testing.
4. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools can evaluate data and forecast potential defect locations.
5. Test coverage and overall program quality will both increase as a result.
6. Test automation will reduce manual effort, improve test coverage, and help deliver higherquality software in less time.
